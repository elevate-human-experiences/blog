# Writing Style Guide

This style guide captures the voice, tone, and structural patterns used across blog.elevate.do content to ensure consistency when Claude assists with writing.

## Voice & Tone

### Conversational Authority
- **Conversational yet informed**: Blend casual accessibility with technical expertise
- **Direct and honest**: Don't sugarcoat problems or oversell solutions  
- **Thoughtful skepticism**: Question hype while exploring genuine potential
- **Personal reflection**: Include first-person experiences and real-world anecdotes

### Example Tone Patterns:
- "Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI slop isn't the biggest problem..."
- "This got me thinking about agent identity, and I wanted to share some quick takeaways..."
- "Short answer: **Yes.** Long answer: AI fluency is becoming..."

## Content Structure

### Frontmatter Format
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description including author and publication date"
---
```

### Content Organization

#### 1. Hook + Context Setting
- Start with a compelling observation or personal anecdote
- Establish the problem or question being explored
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts

#### 2. Clear Section Structure
- Use descriptive headers with markdown (##, ###)
- Break complex topics into digestible sections
- Include numbered lists for step-by-step guidance

#### 3. Visual Elements
- Include relevant images with descriptive alt text
- Use code blocks for technical examples
- Leverage blockquotes for key insights or examples

#### 4. Practical Application
- Always include actionable takeaways
- Provide concrete examples and scenarios
- End with clear next steps or recommendations

### Standard Ending Components

#### Social Sharing Cards
Include the standard CardGroup with:
- LinkedIn sharing
- X/Twitter sharing  
- Calendar scheduling link
- Elevate.do information
- LinkedIn and Twitter follow links

#### Co-authorship Credit
When applicable: 
```markdown
> This article was co-authored with [Name]. You can find them on LinkedIn [here](link).
```

## Writing Patterns

### Opening Styles
- **Problem Statement**: "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been rapidly emerging..."
- **Personal Anecdote**: "Had a fascinating chat with Titus Capilnean today..."
- **Bold Declaration**: "An AI agent's identity is defined by its actions, context, and constraints..."

### Emphasis Techniques
- **Bold** for key concepts and important statements
- *Italics* for emphasis and quoted material  
- `Code formatting` for technical terms and specific tools
- > Blockquotes for scenarios, examples, and key insights

### Technical Content
- Explain technical concepts in accessible language
- Use concrete examples and scenarios
- Include code samples when relevant
- Provide context for acronyms and jargon

### Structural Elements
- **Numbered sections** for step-by-step processes
- **Bullet points** for lists and key takeaways  
- **Subheadings** to break up long sections
- **Horizontal rules (---)** to separate major sections

## Content Types

### Long-Form Technical Articles
- 2000+ words exploring complex topics
- Multiple sections with clear hierarchy
- Extensive use of examples and scenarios
- Detailed implementation guidance

### Musings & Short Thoughts  
- 200-500 words of quick observations
- Often include AI-generated imagery
- Personal reflections on current events
- Lighter tone but still substantive

### Business Analysis
- Data-driven insights with practical implications
- Clear problem/solution structure
- Industry context and competitive analysis
- Strategic recommendations

## Language Guidelines

### Preferred Phrasings
- "Here's what we found:" (not "Our research indicates")
- "The reality is more nuanced" (not "It's complicated")
- "Let's explore what this means" (not "We will examine")

### Avoid
- Corporate jargon and buzzwords
- Overly formal academic language
- Exaggerated claims or hyperbole
- Passive voice when active is clearer

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy
- Verify all factual claims and statistics
- Provide sources for external information
- Test any code examples or technical instructions
- Double-check company names, product names, and technical terms

### Readability
- Aim for clarity over complexity
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Include transition phrases between sections
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

### Value Delivery
- Every article should provide actionable insights
- Include practical examples readers can apply
- Address real problems faced by the target audience
- Balance theoretical concepts with hands-on guidance

## Co-authorship Guidelines

When working with co-authors (like Adria Hou):
- Clearly attribute collaborative work
- Maintain consistent voice throughout
- Include co-author bio links in the standard footer
- Ensure both perspectives are represented fairly
