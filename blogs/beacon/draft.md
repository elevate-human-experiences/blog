üöÄ Call for Startups: Contrarian Bets for the Next DecadeAn Angel Portfolio Seeking Founders Who See What Others Miss

The Philosophy

We're not looking for the next Uber for X. We're looking for founders who understand that the biggest opportunities hide in plain sight, disguised as "boring" problems or "solved" markets. The best startups don't follow trends‚Äîthey create them by solving problems everyone else thinks are too hard, too niche, or too obvious.
If you're building in one of these areas, let's talk.

üì± 1. Lovable for Indie Games: The Weekend Game Studio

The Quirky Truth: While AAA studios spend $100M and 5 years building the next Candy Crush killer, solo developers using Lovable are shipping playable prototypes every Saturday morning over coffee.
The Serious Thesis: With 25,000 new Lovable projects created daily, we're witnessing a fundamental shift in game development economics. Mobile gaming is a $100B market dominated by studios that move like oil tankers. But game design isn't engineering‚Äîit's rapid hypothesis testing. The winners aren't those with the best initial idea, but those who can test 1,000 bad ideas fastest. A solo developer who can ship weekly prototypes will discover hit mechanics 50x faster than a studio with 100-person teams and quarterly review cycles. The tools now exist; we're betting on founders who understand that velocity beats perfection in entertainment markets.

üß† 2. Prompt Self-Healing: Autonomous Driving for AI

The Quirky Truth: Your prompts are like teenagers‚Äîthey work perfectly when you're watching, then immediately break the moment you look away.
The Serious Thesis: 95% of code in YC's latest batch is AI-generated, yet prompt engineering remains a dark art where changing "summarize" to "outline" can break entire workflows. We need prompts that observe their own outputs and auto-correct when they drift‚Äîsimilar to how Tesla's autopilot learns from edge cases. This system would detect output inconsistencies across multiple runs, build memory layers for context persistence, and ensure the same SQL query generates from the same natural language input every time. The company that makes AI outputs deterministic and self-improving captures the entire enterprise AI market, currently paralyzed by unpredictability.

üéì 3. Claude Artifacts for Classrooms: Teaching at the Speed of Curiosity

The Quirky Truth: Teachers are already master improvisers‚Äînow imagine them with superpowers, spawning interactive black hole simulations mid-lesson when little Timmy asks, "But what happens to time?"
The Serious Thesis: 500 million artifacts have been created by regular users, proving real-time content generation works. Traditional EdTech failed because it made teaching more rigid with pre-recorded videos and fixed curricula. But the best teachers already adapt constantly based on micro-expressions of confusion. Artifacts make teaching more fluid‚Äîallowing educators to generate custom visualizations, simulations, and exercises in real-time based on student questions. This isn't replacing teachers; it's giving them Iron Man suits. The platform that enables this captures the $8T global education market by making every teacher capable of Feynman-level explanations.

üè¶ 4. On-Prem Agent Orchestration: Unlocking Regulated Trillions

The Quirky Truth: Banks have more GPUs than gaming cafes but can't use ChatGPT because their lawyers break out in hives at the thought of customer data touching OpenAI's servers.
The Serious Thesis: AI agents dominate Silicon Valley conversations, but they're completely absent from the industries that move trillions‚Äîhealthcare, finance, defense‚Äîbecause these sectors legally cannot send data to cloud APIs. The first fully on-premise agent orchestration layer that provides observability, governance, and compliance unlocks $50T in regulated data currently sitting idle. This isn't just about privacy; it's about building the infrastructure layer that allows Goldman Sachs to run the same agent swarms as a YC startup, but within their own data centers. Whoever builds this owns enterprise AI adoption.

‚úçÔ∏è 5. AI for Novelists: The Consistency Engine

The Quirky Truth: Writers don't have writer's block‚Äîthey have "wait, did I say the detective was allergic to cats in chapter 3 or chapter 13?" block.
The Serious Thesis: AI helps marketers write 100-word ads at scale, but maintaining voice, plot consistency, and character development across 100,000 words is exponentially harder. Professional authors abandon 70% of novels not due to lack of ideas but inability to maintain coherence. An AI that tracks every detail‚Äîfrom character eye colors to subplot timelines to narrative voice patterns‚Äîand ensures chapter 30 sounds like chapter 1 while preventing plot holes enables writers to focus on creativity rather than continuity. The global publishing market is $130B; whoever solves consistency captures the entire creative writing vertical.

üñ±Ô∏è 6. YAML to Clicks: Infrastructure as Actual Code

The Quirky Truth: DevOps engineers automate everything except the 4 hours daily they spend clicking through admin panels like it's 1999.
The Serious Thesis: IT teams waste 40% of their time navigating labyrinthine settings across 50+ SaaS tools. A declarative config language that translates YAML to automated browser actions would turn 3-day ServiceNow tickets into 3-minute deploys. Imagine: salesforce.users.permissions: admin automatically clicking through Salesforce's 17-screen permission flow. Small teams can build billion-dollar companies with $500k but lose half their velocity to repetitive clicking. The first "ClickOps as Code" platform that treats UI interactions as deployable, version-controlled infrastructure captures the entire IT automation market currently drowning in manual processes.

üîç 7. AI Interaction Health Monitor: The Hidden Dependency Crisis

The Quirky Truth: We track screen time but ignore that people are outsourcing their thinking to ChatGPT faster than they outsourced their memory to Google.
The Serious Thesis: 200 million weekly ChatGPT users are rewiring their cognitive patterns with zero visibility into the changes. Like social media addiction, AI dependency creates invisible behavioral drift‚Äîusers stop fact-checking, lose critical thinking skills, and develop learned helplessness for basic reasoning tasks. The first comprehensive "AI interaction health monitor" that tracks cognitive delegation patterns, flags dangerous dependencies, and suggests digital detox protocols becomes as essential as antivirus software. This isn't anti-AI; it's ensuring humans maintain agency while using AI tools. The company that builds this captures both enterprise wellness programs and consumer digital health markets.

üîê 8. Agent Action Audit Trail: The Compliance Layer

The Quirky Truth: Your AI agent just made 10,000 decisions in the last minute, and your compliance team has no idea if one of them just triggered a GDPR violation worth a year's revenue.
The Serious Thesis: Enterprises deploy AI agents for massive productivity gains but have zero visibility into micro-decisions that could trigger regulatory disasters. A single unauthorized data transfer could mean $100M fines, yet companies can't resist 10x productivity improvements. The platform that provides complete agent action auditing‚Äîevery API call, every decision branch, every data access‚Äîwith real-time anomaly detection and compliance checking becomes mandatory infrastructure. This is the "Datadog for AI agents," capturing value as the picks-and-shovels provider for the autonomous enterprise revolution.

üîÑ 9. AI Code Entropy Tracker: The Technical Debt Tsunami

The Quirky Truth: GitHub Copilot is like a very eager intern who rewrites all your code at 3 AM‚Äîsometimes making it better, sometimes setting everything on fire.
The Serious Thesis: AI writes 46% of code in enabled repos, shipping 10x faster but creating hidden technical debt bombs. Developers can't distinguish between AI improvements and AI-introduced regressions until production breaks. A system tracking "code entropy"‚Äîdetecting when AI makes things worse, not better‚Äîsaves companies from unmaintainable codebases. This includes: regression detection, complexity analysis, and identifying when AI repeatedly "fixes" working code. The first platform to quantify and prevent AI-induced technical debt becomes essential infrastructure as every codebase becomes AI-hybrid.

üí≥ 10. Payment Rails for Autonomous Agents: The Machine Economy

The Quirky Truth: AI agents are ready to build trillion-dollar businesses, but they can't even get a Stripe account because they fail the "I'm not a robot" test.
The Serious Thesis: By 2026, autonomous agents will need to transact‚Äîpaying for compute, data, APIs, and services from other agents. But the entire financial system assumes human actors. The first "Stripe for AI agents"‚Äîprogrammable wallets with spending rules, fraud detection, and agent-to-agent payment protocols‚Äîowns the transaction layer for all machine-to-machine commerce. This includes: micropayments for API calls, escrow for multi-agent collaborations, and reputation systems for agent trustworthiness. Whoever builds this infrastructure becomes the Visa of the autonomous economy, taking a cut of every machine transaction.

üéØ 11. Voice AI for Small Business Operations

The Quirky Truth: Small business owners are too busy to type but somehow have time for 47 phone calls a day‚Äîlet's meet them where they are.
The Serious Thesis: Small businesses run on point-of-sale systems and laptops but operate through voice‚Äîendless phone calls with suppliers, quick verbal notes, shouted inventory counts. A voice agent that recognizes individual speakers and handles back-office tasks (ordering, stocking, scheduling) through natural conversation unlocks productivity for 33 million US small businesses. This isn't Alexa asking about the weather; it's understanding "We're low on the usual" means reordering 50 pounds of coffee beans from the regular supplier. The company that makes enterprise operations as simple as conversation captures the SMB market that big tech ignores.

üèÉ 12. AI-Powered Longevity Coaching: The 100-Year Life OS

The Quirky Truth: People spend $4,000 on Pelotons to live longer but make 50 daily decisions that shorten their lifespan‚Äîand they have no idea which ones matter.
The Serious Thesis: The longevity market is exploding ($8B today, projected $27B by 2030), but it's fragmented across supplements, wearables, diets, and protocols with no unified intelligence layer. An AI that synthesizes personal health data, lifestyle patterns, and cutting-edge longevity research to provide personalized, actionable daily guidance becomes the operating system for the 100-year life. This isn't another fitness tracker; it's an AI that knows whether that 9 PM coffee or skipped morning walk matters more for your specific biology and goals. The platform that makes longevity science actionable for individuals captures the entire preventive health market.
