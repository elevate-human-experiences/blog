The comic is my silly take on putting vibe-based-work everywhere. What if payroll ran with vibes as engineers are.

**Vibe Coding**—the practice of using AI to generate code based on natural language prompts—has been a hot topic in tech circles lately. While it offers rapid prototyping capabilities, it's essential to understand both its advantages and limitations. Personally, I agree with Ben South's post on X: *"Vibe coding is all fun and games until you have to vibe debug"*.

**Here are a few thoughts 👇**

- 🧑‍💻 **Treat the AI like a junior dev:** Let it draft, but insist on code reviews, tests, and refactors—otherwise, technical debt snowballs fast.
- 🔐 **Security is not a vibe:** Your LLM can be confidently wrong. Generated code can hide nasty vulnerabilities—automate static analysis, secret scanning, and dependency checks from Day 1.
- ⚡ **Creative speed ≠ long-term maintainability:** Rapid MVPs look great in demos, yet lack longitudinal data on bug costs and total cost of ownership. Refactoring entire codebases presents its own challenges of dropped logic and needle-in-a-haystack issues.
- 📉📈 **Career impact is polarized:** Entry-level postings are shrinking, yet senior engineers mastering AI-assisted workflows are reporting real productivity gains. (Refer to the Jedi chart.)
- 🧠 **Upskill in prompt design + architecture:** The safest seats combine system thinking and AI fluency—be the person who can steer and debug the machine. 

*🐑 "AI Shepherd" might be a job requirement.*
