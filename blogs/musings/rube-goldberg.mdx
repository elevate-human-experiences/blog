You folks know what a Rube Goldberg machine is, right?

As I implement at-scale complex multi-step workflows for my clients, I'm reminded of how the non-deterministic nature of LLMs compounds with multiple downstream steps. Combine that with standard engineering realities‚Äîrate limits, flaky connections, retries, timeouts‚Äîand it quickly becomes more than a toy problem. It becomes real engineering.

Take one of my current workflows: it takes **15 minutes** to complete. That‚Äôs not idle time‚Äîit‚Äôs churning through PDF parsing, database reconciliation, structured-to-unstructured transformations, all of which carry their own failure probabilities. 

At one point, I parallelized tasks using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, but rolled it back after too many hard-to-debug errors. Turns out, a pesky 503 from Bedrock was derailing things mid-run.

At this scale, you‚Äôre not just prototyping‚Äîyou‚Äôre building distributed, fault-tolerant systems. AI workflows need the same care we give to production infra. 

So, yeah‚Ä¶ the comic above? It‚Äôs a little funny, but also a little too real.

All this‚Ä¶ from one reply. Welcome to the future of autonomous growth.
