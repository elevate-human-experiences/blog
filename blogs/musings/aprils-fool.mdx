There's lot going on today. But as I add to the infinite scroll of Studio Ghibli anime-esque pictures online, 
and watching a self-driving car shuttling probable millionaires through SF streets, amid the stark contrast of everyday struggles you see on the streets,
I can't help but wonder if the right path to the world I want to see. The fool, I sometimes think, is me (it's April 1st). 

Couldn't help but recall something we read in school.
