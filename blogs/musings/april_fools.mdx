There's lot going on today. But as I browse the infinite scroll of Studio Ghibli anime-esque pictures, 
the MCP overload, and shuttling through SF streets in a self-driving car that takes over a 
hundred thousand dollar car to equip amid the stark contrast of everyday struggles you see on the streets,
I can’t help but wonder if the fool (it's April 1st) is me. Couldn't help but recall something
we read in school.

> Monkeys with a bland grin on our faces.”
