There's lot going on today. But as I add to the infinite scroll of Studio Ghibli anime-esque pictures online, 
and watching a self-driving car shuttling probable millionaires through SF streets, amid the stark contrast of everyday struggles you see on the streets,
I can't help but wonder if the right path to the world I want to see. The fool, I sometimes think, is me (it's April 1st). 

Couldn't help but recall something we read in school. 

> “For God's sake, let us be men
> not monkeys minding machines
> or sitting with our tails curled
> while the machine amuses us, the radio or film or gramophone.
> 
> Monkeys with a bland grin on our faces.”
>        ― D.H. Lawrence, Selected Letters, 1925.
