**An AI agent's identity is defined by its actions, context, and constraints—not merely by a name or static scope.**

### The Prompt Control Problem

Over the last few weeks, I've been experimenting with Claude Desktop and custom-built MCPs (Model Context Protocols). One thing that immediately stood out: you can't update the prompt. This means I have no control over how to guide the agent into doing work *the way I work*.

This got me thinking about agent identity, and I wanted to share some quick takeaways—then I'd love to hear how you're approaching this in your projects.

When people do work, they operate within a **Role**, but *how* you execute that work is probably different than how someone else with the same title at your organization does their work. This personal approach is the unique value you bring.

So here's the question: Is there a mechanism for you to tell an agent how you do your work, in a world where prompts are becoming increasingly controlled by the chatbots you use and the MCP tools they run?

I think the answer lies in rethinking agent identity altogether.

### The Missing Layer: From Prompt Control to Agent Identity

The MCP prompt control problem reveals a deeper architectural challenge. Current AI systems conflate **what an agent can do** (capabilities) with **how it should behave** (identity). Traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) gives us binary permissions, but what we really need is a way to encode not just *permissions*, but *preferences*, *workflows*, and *context-aware decision making*.

This is where a more sophisticated model of agent identity becomes crucial. Instead of losing control over how an agent works when using tools like Claude Desktop with MCPs, we need a framework that preserves and expresses your unique working style across different AI interactions.

### Why We Need More Than RBAC

In today's AI-driven world, agents perform critical tasks autonomously. Beyond asking whether an agent *can* perform an action, we must define *when*, *why*, and *under what context* it should—and should not—act. Traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) employs static, binary scopes (e.g., `gmail.read`, `slack.post`) that quickly become unwieldy across multiple roles and environments.

> **Scenario:** Rahul Parundekar uses a single inbox (`rahul@aihero.studio`) to:
>
> * Oversee investor communications as **CEO**
> * Address on-call alerts as **DevOps Lead**
> * Manage RSVPs as **Community Organizer**
> * Analyze portfolio performance as **Investor**
>
> A blanket `gmail.read` permission would let a DevOps agent inspect payroll emails or allow an Investor bot to archive deployment alerts—outcomes that violate principle of least privilege.

### A Contextual Ontology: Roles, Profiles, Agents

To resolve these limitations, we propose three foundational concepts:

1. **Role**
   Defines a set of context-aware, semantic permission clauses within an **Organization**.
2. **Profile**
   Binds a **Person** to a specific **Role** within an **Organization**.
3. **Agent**
   A software principal that *assumes* a **Profile**, acting on behalf of the associated **Person**.

---

#### 1. Role

A `Role` lives inside an organization and comprises:

* `organization`: Identifier (e.g., `AI Hero Inc.` or `org-12345`)
* `title`: Role name (e.g., `CEO`, `DevOps`)
* `capabilities`: A list of high-level policy clauses (RFC‑style):

  * `MUST`: Obligations
  * `SHOULD`: Recommendations
  * `MUST NOT`: Prohibitions
  * `MAY` or `CAN`: Optional capabilities

```yaml
# DevOps @ AI Hero Inc.
id: role-devops-aihero
organization: AI Hero Inc.
title: DevOps
capabilities:
  - CAN read infrastructure alert emails.
  - MUST verify sender domains match approved analytics providers.
  - SHOULD tag processed alerts with label "DevOps".
  - MUST NOT access financial or HR-related messages.
```

---

#### 2. Profile

A `Profile` associates a **Person** with a **Role**. Profiles contain no additional instructions and represent the static binding between a person and a role. Agents may assume any existing profile.

```yaml
# Rahul's CEO profile
id: profile-ceo-aihero
person: Rahul Parundekar
role: role-ceo-aihero
```

---

#### Persona

A `Persona` extends a `Profile` by including task-specific instructions. Personas encapsulate both the role and the operational guidance an agent should follow.

1. **Newsletter Manager Persona**

```yaml
id: persona-newsletter-manager-aihero
role: role-ceo-aihero
instructions:
  - Fetch and tag weekly newsletter emails.
  - Send a summary to internal-comm@aihero.studio every Monday at 10:00 PT.
  - Archive processed newsletters into folder "Newsletters".
```

2. **Board Interaction Persona**

```yaml
id: persona-board-interaction-aihero
role: role-ceo-aihero
instructions:
  - Prioritize emails containing "Board" or "Investor" keywords.
  - Schedule follow-up meetings in Calendar when requested.
  - Log meeting minutes to the #board channel on Slack.
```

3. **Team Morale Persona**

```yaml
id: persona-team-morale-aihero
role: role-ceo-aihero
instructions:
  - Check the #team-happiness Slack channel daily.
  - Send positive feedback or shout-outs to team members.
  - Flag any morale issues by creating a ticket in the HR system.
```

---

#### ProfileConstraint

A `ProfileConstraint` defines the subset of profiles or personas an agent is authorized to assume.

```yaml
id: constraint-rahul-assumable-profiles
agent: chatgpt-01
allowed_profiles:
  - persona-newsletter-manager-aihero
  - persona-board-interaction-aihero
  - persona-team-morale-aihero
```

---

#### 3. Agent

An `Agent` is a programmatic identity that selects one `Profile` before acting:

```yaml
agent: chatgpt-01
profile: profile-ceo-aihero
```

When an agent executes, its capabilities and constraints derive directly from its current profile.

---

### Example: Fine-Grained Gmail Permissions

Model Rahul’s **CEO** profile with contextual Gmail access:

```yaml
# CEO @ AI Hero Inc.
id: role-ceo-aihero
organization: AI Hero Inc.
title: CEO
capabilities:
  - MUST read emails containing investor or board-related keywords.
  - SHOULD archive newsletters into folder "CEO-News".
  - MAY send emails from rahul@aihero.studio.
  - MUST log sent-message IDs to the audit service.
  - MUST NOT operate outside 09:00–17:00 PT.
```

### Advantages

* **Least Privilege by Context:** Agents operate only within their profile’s scope and temporal constraints.
* **Expressive Policy DSL:** Free-text, RFC-like clauses capture real-world nuances.
* **Unified Model:** No separate contract layer; *Roles* encapsulate both scope and policy.


### Future Directions

In an upcoming post, we will explore how to integrate this context-rich identity model with standard authentication frameworks (such as OAuth 2.1) to enforce these roles and profiles in practice. By combining our ontological approach with robust authentication tokens and protocols, we aim to complete the picture for secure, end-to-end agent authorization. Stay tuned!
