---

When you're setting up a Kubernetes cluster, DevOps and Platform engineers feel like they're navigating a maze. 
Take a simple service deployment: you might have to check the deployment (`kubectl get deployment`), the service (`kubectl get service`), inspect events (`kubectl describe pod`), the logs (`kubectl logs pod-name`), and even Ingress rules (`kubectl get ingress`). 
Each step requires context, copy-pasting names and ids from one place into another.
A single typo can leave you scratching your head. Worse, incomplete information can lead you down the wrong path and waste hours.
The complexity of multi-step diagnostics, especially when things go wrong, can be overwhelming.

## Why Kubernetes troubleshooting still hurts and why we built `k8x`.

Even veteran SREs know the familiar pain cycle:

| Symptom                                            | Usual manual steps                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pods in `CrashLoopBackOff`                         | • `kubectl get pods -A` → copy failing names <br/> • `kubectl logs …` (repeat per pod & container) <br/> • grep for hints, cross-check ConfigMaps |
| 503s on an Ingress                                 | • Check Service endpoints → kube-proxy rules → NetworkPolicy <br/> • Compare readiness probes & resource pressure|
| "`myservice` works on *most* nodes"                         | • Inspect taints/labels, daemonsets, CNI logs <br/> • Describe nodes for kernel versions & allocatable|

Each scenario is *multi-step*, context-heavy, and needs you to track context across multiple kubernetes commands. 
You need to keep a note of resource ids to use them in other resource descriptions and logs to know what's going on. 

## The agentic leap: from *suggestion* to *orchestrated review*

Recent agents like **GitHub Copilot Chat** (in VS Code w/ terminal access), **Claude Code** (terminal-native edits) and Goose showed a new pattern: the LLM *drives* an interactive loop—executes safe commands autonomously, then narrates the findings.
General-purpose LLM helpers (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot Chat) can go beyond **suggesting** commands - they can copy-paste, re-run, and stitch results together.
*k8x* applies this agentic idea to Kubernetes:

* **Natural-language prompts** → e.g. "Find pods that aren't ready and tell me why."
* The agent **plans** a sequence: `kubectl get …`, `kubectl describe …`, maybe `kubectl top …`.
* It **executes** those *read-only* commands, parses output, and **reasons** about root causes.
* Results appear as an **explanation first**, with raw command logs one keystroke away.

Unlike code-centric tools, *k8x* is infra-native. It understands resource kinds, status fields, events, and failure taxonomies (image pull, scheduling, OOMKilled).

## Design choices that matter to operators

`k8x` works in your console with the your current `kubectl` configuration, to perform autonomous, multi-step workflows to detect and troubleshoot kubernetes issues with your credentials.

| Principle                          | Experience                                                | Why it builds trust                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read-only by default (v0.1)**    | Zero risk of deletions; mirrors commands you could type   | Safely trial AI before granting mutate rights (\[GitHub]\[3]) |
| **Plain `kubectl` under the hood** | Familiar audit trail; works anywhere your kubeconfig does | No proprietary sidecars or admission webhooks                 |
| **Multi-LLM back-end**             | Select OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini at `k8x configure`       | Avoid vendor lock-in; keep traffic in-house                   |
| **Command history & undo**         | `k8x history list` shows past sessions                    | Auditors see exactly what ran; SREs replay in staging         |

There's more to come, including write permissions, parallelism, etc. Conrtributions are welcome. 

## A day in the life with *k8x*

```bash
# 1️⃣ Something is off
default$ k8x -c "my checkout service is returning 502s"

# 2️⃣ Agent plan (condensed)
• Check Ingress status
• Verify Service endpoints
• Scan pod readiness & logs
• Examine recent HPA events

# 3️⃣ Summary
❌ 2/5 endpoints unhealthy
↳ Pods stuck in Init:CrashLoopBackOff (db-migrations)
↳ Migration container fails on `ALTER TABLE …` (lock timeout)
Suggested fix: run `kubectl exec` into db-migration-pod or scale replicas to 0/1 to release lock
```

In \~30 seconds, you get an actionable story instead of fifteen manual commands.

## How a *multi-step* review actually works

1. **Intent parsing** - Translates English prompts into an internal diagnostic goal.
2. **Planning** - LLM selects a **safe** chain of read-only `kubectl` queries.
3. **Adaptive execution** - After each command, it decides if deeper queries are needed.
4. **Reasoning & templated explanations** - Maps results to known issue patterns for a deterministic, auditable summary.

Only redacted command output reaches the LLM—no full application logs—another trust measure.

## Where *k8x* stands in the AI-ops landscape

| Tool                    | Domain                | Autonomy                           | Local-first? | Write access        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat** | Code / CI             | Suggests fixes, runs queries in UI | No           | Optional PR commits |
| **Claude Code**         | Code & CLI automation | Plans & edits files                | Yes          | Yes (file edits)    |
| **Goose**               | Multi-agent dev tasks | Runs terminal commands             | Yes          | Yes                 |
| **k8x (v0.1)**          | Kubernetes operations | Plans & executes `kubectl` reads   | Yes          | No (read-only)      |

*k8x* fills the gap for platform and DevOps engineers looking for Copilot-level assistance after deployment, not just in CI/CD.

## Getting started in 60 seconds

```bash
brew tap aihero/k8x
brew install k8x         # installs v0.1.1
k8x configure            # choose LLM & set API key
k8x -c "Are all pods running?"
```

You'll never look at a 3-screen tmux layout the same way again.

## Roadmap sneak-peek

* **v0.2 - Declarative fixes**

  * Generate a patch plan (`kubectl diff`) and let humans `--approve`.
* **Terraform & cloud-CLI mode**

  * Run `terraform plan` or `aws eks update-kubeconfig` as sub-steps.
* **Cluster runbooks as code**

  * Store successful sessions as YAML recipes to auto-trigger on alerts.

## Final thoughts

Generative-AI agents are moving from IDEs into production infrastructure. By combining **LLM planning**, **policy-guarded execution**, and **domain-specific reasoning**, *k8x* transforms Kubernetes troubleshooting from a scavenger hunt into a guided review. Start with read-only diagnostics today; when you're ready, the agent will apply fixes—one audited pull request at a time.
