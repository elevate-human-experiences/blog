## Widespread AI Usage Mandates from Leadership  
In the wake of Shopify’s April 7 memo declaring AI “non-optional” ([Internal memo: Shopify CEO declares AI ‘non-optional’](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2025/04/08/internal-memo-shopify-ceo-declares-ai-non-optional/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReflexive%20AI%20usage%20is%20now,expectation%20at%20Shopify%2C%E2%80%9D%20L%C3%BCtke%20wrote)), many employees report their own leaders suddenly **mandating the use of AI tools** in daily work. In one case, a system administrator described how his CEO – a hands-on developer – emailed the whole company to push AI adoption: *“he just discovered that he can delegate coding of unit tests to [ChatGPT]… so now **every dev must use AI**”* ([CEO wants everyone to use an AI. I have zero idea on what I can use it for. : r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1f9q5b6/ceo_wants_everyone_to_use_an_ai_i_have_zero_idea/#:~:text=,every%20dev%20must%20use%20AI)). The CEO even **offered to cover AI service fees** and “strongly encourages (quasi-mandates) all the dev[s] to use it” (even the infrastructure team) ([CEO wants everyone to use an AI. I have zero idea on what I can use it for. : r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1f9q5b6/ceo_wants_everyone_to_use_an_ai_i_have_zero_idea/#:~:text=,every%20dev%20must%20use%20AI)). 

Other tech workers share similar experiences. One developer noted that **management purchased an AI coding tool (Cursor Pro)** for all engineers “and said that they expect to see a return on that investment” ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=%E2%96%AA%EF%B8%8F%20Management%20Mandating%20AI%20Tool,it%27s%20my%20fault%20they%20spent)). At an all-hands meeting, their CTO demoed Cursor’s AI assistant and **signaled it should become “an integral part of how everyone is writing code”** going forward ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=%E2%96%AA%EF%B8%8F%20Management%20Mandating%20AI%20Tool,it%27s%20my%20fault%20they%20spent)). As another Redditor quipped, companies have *“signed big deals with enterprise [AI] software… so employees damn well **find a use**”* for these tools ([CEOs Are Telling Their Employees to Embrace AI–or Become Irrelevant : r/antiwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1jwdk53/ceos_are_telling_their_employees_to_embrace_aior/#:~:text=CEOs%20are%20saying%20this%20shit,not%20seeing%20magically%20higher%20returns)). Some employees feel these top-down directives are misguided or coercive: *“AI tools are being pushed in my company as well. Like it’s my fault they spent money on it and now I’m forced to use them.”* ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=all,it%27s%20my%20fault%20they%20spent)) This sentiment highlights the **frustration** among staff who feel pressured to use AI simply to justify leadership’s investment.

## AI Usage as a Performance Criterion  
A major theme is companies tying AI adoption to **performance reviews and goals**. Shopify’s leaked memo made “reflexive AI usage” a *“baseline expectation”* and stated that **AI competency will be a formal part of performance reviews** ([Internal memo: Shopify CEO declares AI ‘non-optional’](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2025/04/08/internal-memo-shopify-ceo-declares-ai-non-optional/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReflexive%20AI%20usage%20is%20now,expectation%20at%20Shopify%2C%E2%80%9D%20L%C3%BCtke%20wrote)). Employees at other firms are seeing the same shift. One engineer said AI use has been *“written into all engineering role performance expectations”* at his (non-Shopify) company ([Shopify CEO says no new hires without proof AI can’t do the job : r/ruby](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1jujizb/shopify_ceo_says_no_new_hires_without_proof_ai/#:~:text=It%27s%20been%20written%20into%20all,there%20you%20are%20golden)). According to him, embracing AI is practically the only thing his VP cares about now – *“he could give a [****] about the actual work, as long as you are actively posting in the AI… Slack channel and being a ‘thought leader’ there you are golden”* ([Shopify CEO says no new hires without proof AI can’t do the job : r/ruby](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1jujizb/shopify_ceo_says_no_new_hires_without_proof_ai/#:~:text=It%27s%20been%20written%20into%20all,there%20you%20are%20golden)). In other words, **showcasing AI use has become a key metric** for career success in some organizations. Another commenter observed that Shopify is even requiring employees to **justify why they didn’t use AI** for a given task as part of project reviews ([Internal memo: Shopify CEO declares AI ‘non-optional’](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2025/04/08/internal-memo-shopify-ceo-declares-ai-non-optional/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReflexive%20AI%20usage%20is%20now,expectation%20at%20Shopify%2C%E2%80%9D%20L%C3%BCtke%20wrote)). Many workers are uneasy that their **job evaluations now hinge on AI usage** rather than just quality or output of work.

## Mandatory AI Training and Onboarding  
Some employees are encountering **mandatory AI training programs** as companies push internal adoption. On Reddit, a software developer shared: *“My company today told us to learn AI… They literally mean go watch training videos that help you use AI in your job.”* ([My company today told us to learn AI : r/cscareerquestions - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h659qw/my_company_today_told_us_to_learn_ai/#:~:text=My%20company%20today%20told%20us,watch%20training%20videos%20on%20it)) This reflects a growing trend of employers requiring staff to **complete AI onboarding** modules or tutorials. However, not everyone finds these trainings useful – the same user felt watching basic videos wasn’t necessary for something like ChatGPT which many can pick up on their own ([My company today told us to learn AI : r/cscareerquestions - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h659qw/my_company_today_told_us_to_learn_ai/#:~:text=My%20company%20today%20told%20us,watch%20training%20videos%20on%20it)). Overall, while tech news outlets and consultancies tout company-wide AI upskilling, employees report that in practice it’s often **informal video mandates or rushed “learn it yourself” directives**. (One Reddit discussion inquired if any CEOs have rolled out formal AI training programs, with the poster noting that despite buzz in HBR/Forbes, they “have not seen any company doing it” in a structured way ([Anyone considering training programs on AI for employees? - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/1bw8f8a/anyone_considering_training_programs_on_ai_for/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,seen%20any%20company%20doing%20it)).)

## AI-Driven Productivity Pressure and Headcount Fears  
Finally, workers are noticing that leadership’s AI mandates come with **implications for staffing and workload**. Shopify’s CEO explicitly told teams they must prove a job *“cannot be done using AI”* before requesting to hire someone new ([Internal memo: Shopify CEO declares AI ‘non-optional’](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2025/04/08/internal-memo-shopify-ceo-declares-ai-non-optional/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReflexive%20AI%20usage%20is%20now,expectation%20at%20Shopify%2C%E2%80%9D%20L%C3%BCtke%20wrote)). This mentality is spreading fear that AI productivity gains will be used to **justify hiring freezes or even layoffs**. *“Ever since we adopted AI coding assistants, management is talking about ‘optimizing’ the team. I’m worried about layoffs,”* one developer confessed ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=because%20AI%20does%20it%20for,that%20AI%20tools%20have%20caused)). He and others describe managers now expecting projects to be done in *half the time* thanks to AI, and setting **unrealistic deadlines** on the assumption that automation can pick up the slack ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=because%20AI%20does%20it%20for,that%20AI%20tools%20have%20caused)). There’s also evidence of companies tracking AI-derived efficiency: one Redditor said his firm started **measuring “‘hours saved’” in expected work** due to their internal AI tool ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=money%20on%20it%20and%20now,to%20use%20it%20and%20report)). He had *“no problem with AI assisting in coding,”* but **“being forced to use it and report ‘hours saved’ feels wrong”* ([#cybersecurity #softwareengineering #vulnerabilitymanagement #ai… | Nick Lasenko, CISSP, CISA](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicklasenko_cybersecurity-softwareengineering-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7310330833733656576-m9Ph#:~:text=money%20on%20it%20and%20now,to%20use%20it%20and%20report)). Such practices make employees feel that **human effort is being devalued**, and any inability to speed up could put their jobs at risk. 

In summary, in the weeks following Shopify’s bold AI mandate, Reddit has been rife with firsthand accounts of similar internal policy shifts. Employees across industries – especially in tech – report **new expectations to incorporate AI tools**, sometimes even as formal requirements in performance evaluations. Reactions range from cautious acceptance (finding AI genuinely helpful for productivity) to resistance and anxiety, particularly when **mandates are enforced bluntly or tied to job security**. The common thread in these discussions is a feeling that AI is no longer just an optional helper, but rather a **compulsory part of the modern workplace** – whether workers are ready or not.
